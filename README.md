OutlineText is a lightweight markup language that has been developed to make it easy to understand the outline of a document at the plain text level.
Unlike other lightweight markup languages (Markdown, AsciiDoc, ReStructuredText, â€¦), the indentation represents the hierarchical structure of the text.
This makes the hierarchical structure of the text easier to understand visually.

Example:

```
# Heading
    Paragraph

# List
    * item1
    * item2
```
